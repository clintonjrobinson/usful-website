<!--
route is used to define a client side route and show / hide content.

ie. if there is a set of controls you want to show when the user navigates to /todo/123
you would create a route control like

<trm-route route='/todo/:id' context='{{context}}'>
  <h1>You are looking at todo {{context.params.id}}</h1>
</trm-route>

The context should be passed in here to be data-bound.  We do this so that context changes can
propagate UP from this control.

ie. in the control that contains the route control, you should have a context variable that is shared
across all the route controls.

see trm-app.html for example
-->
<polymer-element name='usful-route' attributes="context route active">
  <template>
    <template if='{{active}}'>
      <content></content>
    </template>

  </template>
  <script src="code.js"></script>
</polymer-element>

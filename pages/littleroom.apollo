    <h1>Hope It Was As Awesome For You As It Was For Us</h1>
    
    <p>
        We've never really been a conventional agency. We don't even have a foosball table, and our origin story is less ‘merge and acquire', more ‘ideals and optimism'.
        3 years ago, we had the simple idea that the world deserved a better kind of company, and we were going to be it.
    </p>

    <h1>Our First Chapter</h1>
    
    <p>
        We called our company Little Room because that's where we started: just the three of us, in a little room. We outgrew that space,
        found a home on Adelaide Street, turned it into our office/club house/dinner party locale (occasionally all 3 at the same time),
        and filled it with 30 of the industry's best and brightest.  In 3 short years, we had the privilege of working to grow Little Room
        from a rookie company with no funding and no clients to an award-winning company with international clients.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Now, as our first chapter draws to a close, we want to thank everyone who was a part of it. It has been an absolute pleasure working
        with all of our clients, and we'd like to thank all of you for taking a chance on us.
    </p>

    <p class="team">
       We also need to thank the Little Room family. It would be an enormous understatement to say that this would have been nowhere near
       as a big a success without you, no to mention nowhere near as much fun. We simply cannot thank you enough, and truly hope it was as
       awesome for you as it was for us.
    </p>

    <h1>What's Next?</h1>

    <p>
        With Little Room, we set out to create a better kind of company, and we did it. We created a momentum that has been driving us forward
        since the beginning, and it's time to channel that momentum into new opportunities. It's why we've made the decision to stop making
        advertising that changes minds, and start making useful products that change the world. We're leaving our Little Room for some pretty
        big things.
